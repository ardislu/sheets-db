# sheets-db/demo

Demo here: https://sheets-db.ardis.lu

This is a sample frontend to show how a website would interact with a Google Sheets-based database. Assuming the generated SQLite database is hosted somewhere the frontend can fetch from (for the demo, I pushed the SQLite database to Backblaze).
